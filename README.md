# 271-Floppy-Bird

This project originally consisted of the well known game of Flappy Bird, but it was horizontal instead of vertical like a normal game of Flappy Bird. When trying to change it to vertical, we realized we had created a new game, which we named Floppy Bird. The only difference between the two implementations were just a few lines of code in the move_obstacle module. Commented code in move_obstacle corresponds to our Flappy Bird implementation.
